# Employee Data Management System

## Project Overview

The **Employee Data Management System** is a **full-stack web application** designed to manage employee data with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The system is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It enables users to interact with employee records seamlessly, supporting operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employees. The backend is connected to a **MySQL** database, and the frontend is built to be intuitive and responsive.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:

- **Java**: Primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for developing RESTful APIs, handling business logic, and managing dependencies.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Used for simplifying the data access layer, interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing employee data.
- **RESTful API**: Backend exposes HTTP-based API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool for the backend.

### Frontend:

- **Angular**: Framework for building the frontend of the application. It allows the creation of dynamic, single-page applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript, enabling strong typing and other features for Angular development.
- **HTML, CSS, SCSS**: Core technologies for structuring and styling the application.
- **Angular Material**: Component library to provide modern UI elements like buttons, tables, and forms.
- **Reactive Programming (RxJS)**: Utilized for managing asynchronous data streams and handling HTTP requests.

### Tools & Technologies:

- **Postman**: API testing tool used for verifying the backend endpoints.
- **Git**: Version control system used to manage the codebase and collaborate.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Primary IDE used for both frontend and backend development.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization of the backend and frontend applications (for deployment).
